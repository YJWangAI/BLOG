## About Me
Hi, I'm Yijin Wang. I design, build and operate machine learning systems that serve customers at scale. I also write and speak about DS, ML, NLP and LLMs.

I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at Expedia where I focus on helping travleres have better travel experience.

In my free time, I likes writing technical blog posts, coffee tasting, hiking, traveling and learning new languages.
